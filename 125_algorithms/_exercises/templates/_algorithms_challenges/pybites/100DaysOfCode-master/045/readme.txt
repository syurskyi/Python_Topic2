XML Steam Scraper

A simple script to parse the steam XML feed for new titles.

1. You must first download the file from http://store.steampowered.com/feeds/newreleases.xml.

2. Keep the newreleases.xml file local to the scraper script.

3. Running the script for the first time will create an SQL DB with two columns for the Title and URL.

4. Numerous things can be done from here. Create an emailer that sends the new content to users etc.
