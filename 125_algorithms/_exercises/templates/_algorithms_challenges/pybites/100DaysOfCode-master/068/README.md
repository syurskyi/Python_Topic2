###Â from PyBites import newsletter

Awesome: [@mohhinder](https://twitter.com/mohhinder) translated our `from PyBites import newsletter` into code.

In his own words: 

> Written on iPhone with the Pythonista 3 app as a joke for the PyBites guys, I don't see why it wouldn't work anywhere else though. They always start off their newsletter annoucements with: `from @PyBites import newsletter`, so I turned it into actual code that pulls their feed and opens their latest newsletter in a browser :)
