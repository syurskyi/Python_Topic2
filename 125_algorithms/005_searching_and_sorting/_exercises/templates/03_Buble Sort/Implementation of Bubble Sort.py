# # Implementation of a Bubble Sort
# #
# # The bubble sort makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of
# # order. Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place. In essence, each item bubbles
# # up to the location where it belongs.
