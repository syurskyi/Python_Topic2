Module 6 DepthFirstSearch 

This module contains the KD Tree implementation as developed in this module.
Because the project required changes to the data structure, I have updated
the kdtree.py file to contain all necessary functionality.

Files contained within this module include:

  * graph.py       Adjacency List graph implementation
  * maze.py        App constructing rectangular maze using DFS logic
  * test_graph.py  Rudimentary testing of Graph class and DepthFirstTraversal

Change Log

1. 2014.05.23    Added default execution on __main__ in maze.py to show sample maze
2. 2014.05.23    Fixed typo in name of 'DepthFirstTraversal' class.
