# # We can write partial functional application in python through functools library. Below is a simple example of partial
# # function from the functools library with the add function from the operator library.
#
# add 1 2
# # 3
# add1 = p.. ? 4
# ? 6
# # 10
# ? 10
# # 14
#
# # Partial is a higher order function which takes a function as input (like map and filter) but it also
# # returns a function that can be used in the same way as any other function in your program.
#
# l.. m.. ? |1 2 3 4 5
# # [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# seven = p.... ? 3
# print ?
# # 7
#
# # We can also use partial on object methods, for e.g. to generate a list of default string
# #
#
# str1 _ "Hello, Python"
# helloStr _ p... ?.re___ "Python"
# print ? "Tutorialspoint
# # 'Hello, Tutorialspoint'
# print ? "Java
# # 'Hello, Java'
#
# # Partial function application is a very useful tools especially where you need to apply a range of different
# # input to a single object or need to bind one of the arguments to a function to be constant.
# #
# # Python function helps you to write your code easily and easier to maintain.
