# Find All
# To select data from a table in MongoDB, we can also use the find() method.
# The find() method returns all occurrences in the selection.
# The first parameter of the find() method is a query object. In this example we use an empty query object,
# which selects all documents in the collection.
# No parameters in the find() method gives you the same result as SELECT * in MySQL.
# Example
# Return all documents in the "customers" collection, and print each document:

import pymongo

myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]
mycol = mydb["customers"]

for x in mycol.find():
  print(x)
