# # Find All
# # To select data from a table in MongoDB, we can also use the find() method.
# # The find() method returns all occurrences in the selection.
# # The first parameter of the find() method is a query object. In this example we use an empty query object,
# # which selects all documents in the collection.
# # No parameters in the find() method gives you the same result as SELECT * in MySQL.
# # Example
# # Return all documents in the "customers" collection, and print each document:
#
# _____ ?
#
# myclient _ ?.M.. "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
# mydb _ ? "mydatabase"
# mycol _ ? "customers"
#
# ___ x __ ?.f..
#   print ?
