# # As you can see, the debugging records now appear in the output. Like we mentioned previously, besides changing
# # the log level, you can also decide how to process these messages. For example, say you want to write the logs to
# # a file, you can then use the FileHandler like this:
# 
# ______ l____
# 
# logger _ l____.gL_ -n
# ?.sL_ l____.I..
# 
# # create a file handler
# handler = l____.FH_ hello.log
# ?.sL_ l____.I..
# 
# # create a l____ format
# formatter _ l____.F.. '_ asctime _ - _ name _ - _ levelname _ - _ message _'
# h__.sF_ ?
# 
# # add the file handler to the logger
# l__.aH_ h..
# 
# l__.i.. Hello baby
# 
# # The FileHandler is just one of many useful build-in handlers. In Python, there is even an SMTP log hander
# # for sending records to your mailbox or one for sending the logs to an HTTP server. Cannot find a handler for your
# # need? No worries, you can also write your own custom logging handler if you want. For more details, please reference
# # official documents: Basic Tutorial, Advanced Tutorial and Logging Cookbook.
