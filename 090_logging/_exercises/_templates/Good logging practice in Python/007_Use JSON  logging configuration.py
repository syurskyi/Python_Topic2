# # Use JSON or YAML logging configuration
# # You can configure your logging system in Python code, but then you need to modify your code whenever you want
# # to change the log configuration. Another way to do it is to use a logging configuration file. After Python 2.7,
# # you can load logging configuration from a dict. It means you can load the logging configuration from a JSON or YAML
# # file. Although you can use the old .ini style logging configuration, it is difficult to read and write.
# # Here let me show you the logging configuration examples in JSON and YAML
#
