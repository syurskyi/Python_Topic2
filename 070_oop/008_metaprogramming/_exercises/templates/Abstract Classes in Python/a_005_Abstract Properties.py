# # Abstract Properties :
# # Abstract classes includes attributes in addition to methods, you can require the attributes in concrete classes
# # by defining them with @abstractproperty.
#
# # Python program showing
# # abstract properties
#
# _____ a..
# ____ a.. _____ A.. a..
#
#
# c_ parent A..
#     ??.?
#     ___ geeks
#         r_ "parent class"
#
#
# c_ child ?
#
#     ??
#     ___ geeks
#         r_ "child class"
#
#
# ___
#     r = p..
#     print ?.g..
# _______ E.. __ err
#     print ?
#
# r = c..
# print ?.g..
#
#
# # Output:
# #
# # Can't instantiate abstract class parent with abstract methods geeks
# # child class
# # In the above example, the Base class cannot be instantiated because it has only an abstract version
# # of the property getter method.
