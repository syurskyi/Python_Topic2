# # Concrete Methods in Abstract Base Classes :
# # Concrete classes contain only concrete (normal)methods whereas abstract class contains both concrete methods
# # as well as abstract methods. Concrete class provide an implementation of abstract methods, the abstract base class
# # can also provide an implementation by invoking the methods via super().
# # Let look over the example to invoke the method using super():
#
# # Python program invoking a
# # method using super()
#
# _____ a..
# ____ a.. _____ A.. a..
#
#
# c_ R A...
#     ___ rk
#         print("Abstract Base Class")
#
#
# c_ K R
#     ___ rk
#         s__ .?
#         print("subclass ")
#
#     # Driver code
#
#
# r = K()
# r.rk()
#
# # Output:
# #
# # Abstract Base Class
# # subclass
# # In the above program, we can invoke the methods in abstract classes by using super().
