# # Problem
# # You want to write a decorator function that takes arguments.
# # Solution
# # Letâ€™s illustrate the process of accepting arguments with an example. Suppose you want
# # to write a decorator that adds logging to a function, but allows the user to specify the
# # logging level and other details as arguments. Here is how you might define the decorator:
#
# # On first glance, the implementation looks tricky, but the idea is relatively simple. The
# # outermost function logged() accepts the desired arguments and simply makes them
# # available to the inner functions of the decorator. The inner function decorate() accepts
# # a function and puts a wrapper around it as normal. The key part is that the wrapper is
# # allowed to use the arguments passed to logged().
# # Discussion
# # Writing a decorator that takes arguments is tricky because of the underlying calling
# # sequence involved. Specifically, if you have code like this:
#
# # The decoration process evaluates as follows:
# # ___ func(a, b):
# # pass
# # func _ decorator(x, y, z)(func)
# # Carefully observe that the result of decorator(x, y, z) must be a callable which, in
# # turn, takes a function as input and wraps it. See Recipe 9.7 for another example of a
# # decorator taking arguments.
