# Problem
# You want to automatically record the order in which attributes and methods are defined
# inside a class body so that you can use it in various operations (e.g., serializing, mapping
# to databases, etc.).
# Solution
# Capturing information about the body of class definition is easily accomplished through
# the use of a metaclass. Here is an example of a metaclass that uses an OrderedDict to
# capture definition order of descriptors:

# In this metaclass, the definition order of descriptors is captured by using an Ordered
# Dict during the execution of the class body. The resulting order of names is then extracted
# from the dictionary and stored into a class attribute _order. This can then be
# used by methods of the class in various ways. For example, here is a simple class that
# uses the ordering to implement a method for serializing the instance data as a line of
# CSV data:

# Discussion
# The entire key to this recipe is the __prepare__() method, which is defined in the
# OrderedMeta metaclass. This method is invoked immediately at the start of a class definition
# with the class name and base classes. It must then return a mapping object to
# use when processing the class body. By returning an OrderedDict instead of a normal
# dictionary, the resulting definition order is easily captured.
# It is possible to extend this functionality even further if you are willing to make your
# own dictionary-like objects. For example, consider this variant of the solution that rejects
# duplicate definitions:

# A final important part of this recipe concerns the treatment of the modified dictionary
# in the metaclass __new__() method. Even though the class was defined using an alter‚Äê

# native dictionary, you still have to convert this dictionary to a proper dict instance
# when making the final class object. This is the purpose of the d = dict(clsdict)
# statement.
# Being able to capture definition order is a subtle but important feature for certain kinds
# of applications. For instance, in an object relational mapper, classes might be written in
# a manner similar to that shown in the example:
# class Stock(Model):
# name = String()
# shares = Integer()
# price = Float()
# Underneath the covers, the code might want to capture the definition order to map
# objects to tuples or rows in a database table (e.g., similar to the functionality of the
# as_csv() method in the example). The solution shown is very straightforward and often
# simpler than alternative approaches (which typically involve maintaining hidden counters
# within the descriptor classes).
