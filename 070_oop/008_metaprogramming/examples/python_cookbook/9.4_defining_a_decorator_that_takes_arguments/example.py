# Problem
# You want to write a decorator function that takes arguments.
# Solution
# Letâ€™s illustrate the process of accepting arguments with an example. Suppose you want
# to write a decorator that adds logging to a function, but allows the user to specify the
# logging level and other details as arguments. Here is how you might define the decorator:

# On first glance, the implementation looks tricky, but the idea is relatively simple. The
# outermost function logged() accepts the desired arguments and simply makes them
# available to the inner functions of the decorator. The inner function decorate() accepts
# a function and puts a wrapper around it as normal. The key part is that the wrapper is
# allowed to use the arguments passed to logged().
# Discussion
# Writing a decorator that takes arguments is tricky because of the underlying calling
# sequence involved. Specifically, if you have code like this:

# The decoration process evaluates as follows:
# def func(a, b):
# pass
# func = decorator(x, y, z)(func)
# Carefully observe that the result of decorator(x, y, z) must be a callable which, in
# turn, takes a function as input and wraps it. See Recipe 9.7 for another example of a
# decorator taking arguments.
