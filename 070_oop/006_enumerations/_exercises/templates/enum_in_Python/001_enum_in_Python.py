# # Python code to demonstrate enumerations
# # # importing enum for enumerations
# # # Enumerations in Python are implemented by using the module named enum.Enumerations are created using classes.
# # # Enums have names and values associated with them.
# # # Properties of enum:
# # # 1. Enums can be displayed as string or repr.
# # # 2. Enums can be checked for their types using type().
# # # 3. name keyword is used to display the name of the enum member.
