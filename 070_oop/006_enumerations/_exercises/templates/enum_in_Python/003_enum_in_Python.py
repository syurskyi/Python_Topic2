# # Accessing Modes : Enum members can be accessed by two ways
# # 1. By value :- In this method, the value of enum member is passed.
# # 2. By name :- In this method, the name of enum member is passed.
# # Seperate value or name can also be accessed using name or value keyword.
# # Comparison : Enumerations supports two types of comparisons
# # 1. Identity :- These are checked using keywords is and is not.
# # 2. Equality :- Equality comparisons of == and != types are also supported.
