Hello. My name is Robert Smallshire.

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,997
Welcome to the third module of the

3
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:08,709
Advanced Python course. In this module

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,931
we'll provide details of how objects are

5
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:13,071
represented internally in Python as a

6
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,257
dictionary called dunder dict, and show

7
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,996
how objects can be directly queried and

8
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:19,578
manipulated through this internal

9
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:21,245
dictionary. We'll then use this knowledge

10
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,364
to show how to implement custom attribute

11
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:26,921
access by overriding the special dunder

12
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,472
getattr, dunder getattribute, dunder

13
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:32,994
setattr, and dunder delattr methods. We'll

14
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,062
round off by seeing how to make objects

15
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:40,000
more memory efficient by defining dunder slots.
