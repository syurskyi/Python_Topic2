1
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:04,632
We can prevent this by overriding dunder

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:07,380
setattr too to intercept attempts to write

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,960
to our attributes. In this case, dunder

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,624
setattr is configured to simply raise an

5
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,566
AttributeError with a message explaining

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,375
that we're not allowed to set attributes

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:22,946
on immutable objects of this class. This

8
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:26,427
successfully prevents writing to any

9
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,525
attribute. We'll return to dunder setattr

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:37,000
shortly, but first we need to demonstrate another problem with our dunder getattr.
