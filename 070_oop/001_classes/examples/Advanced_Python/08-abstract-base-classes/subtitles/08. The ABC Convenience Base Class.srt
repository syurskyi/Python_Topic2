The ABC module contains a class, ABC,

2
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:07,508
which is simply a regular class, which has

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,801
ABCMeta as its metaclass. This makes it

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,413
even easier to declare abstract base

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,815
classes without having to put the

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,704
metaclass mechanism on show, which may be

7
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,678
an advantage when coding for an audience

8
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:23,077
who haven't yet been exposed to the

9
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:33,000
concept of metaclasses. Using ABC our Sword class can be simplified a little.
