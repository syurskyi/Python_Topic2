1
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:03,764
It's worth bearing in mind that unlike

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,837
regular base classes, virtual base classes

3
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:08,326
don't play a role in method resolution.

4
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:13,297
We'll demonstrate this by adding a thrust

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:18,268
method to the Sword virtual base class.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:24,792
Now let's create an instance of

7
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:29,731
broad_sword. Invoking swipe on broad_sword

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:33,729
works as expected. Attempts to invoke

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,947
thrust on subclasses raise an attribute

10
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:37,879
error, and checking further, we can see

11
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,089
that sword is not present in the method

12
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:42,418
resolution order for BroadSword. For this

13
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,660
reason, it is not possible to call virtual

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,000
base class methods using super, which relies on searching the mro.
