1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,755
It's also possible to directly register a

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,561
class as a virtual subclass with an

3
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:09,931
abstract base class whose metaclass is

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,141
ABCMeta using the register metamethod. For

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,550
example, let's create an abstract base

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,633
class Text, and register the built-in

7
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,385
type, str, as a virtual subclass. Notice

8
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:24,376
that the register metamethod returns the

9
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:27,035
class which was registered, a point we'll

10
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:31,079
return to in a moment. Now we can even

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,024
retrofit base classes to the built-in

12
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,546
types albeit virtual bases. Here we

13
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,503
demonstrate that the built-in str class is

14
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,539
now considered a subclass of our text

15
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,634
class defined at the REPL, and string

16
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:46,583
objects are instances of Text. Because the

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,633
register metamethod returns it's argument

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,954
we can even use it as a class decorator.

19
00:00:52,954 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's register a class, Prose, as a virtual subclass of Text.
