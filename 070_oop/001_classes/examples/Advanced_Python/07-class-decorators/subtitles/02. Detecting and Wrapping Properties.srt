1
00:00:01,546 --> 00:00:04,074
Recall that the property decorator

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:06,949
produces a descriptor, which wraps the

3
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:09,665
getter and setter methods, but because

4
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:11,929
descriptors aren't callable functions they

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,264
aren't being detected and wrapped by our

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,000
invariant checking function decorator. To

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,323
fix this we need to beef up our machinery

8
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,528
to detect and appropriately proxy these

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,867
descriptors. If we take a peek at

10
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,618
vars(Temperature) we can see that

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:31,369
Fahrenheit and Celsius correspond to

12
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,996
property objects. Ideally, we detect any

13
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:36,669
value in this mapping, which is a

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,603
descriptor, which is any object supporting

15
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:41,194
any of the dunder get, dunder set, or

16
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,288
dunder delete methods. Unfortunately for

17
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:46,066
us, in this case, descriptors are also

18
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:49,006
used for all the functions and methods for

19
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,334
reasons we won't even get into in this

20
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,552
advanced course, so they too would be

21
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:55,841
detected. Instead, we'll go for the

22
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,616
simpler approach of looking for instances

23
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:01,875
of property, how updated class decorator

24
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,448
factory function looks like this. After we

25
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,822
have detected the method names by looking

26
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,889
for callable attributes, we detect the

27
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,273
property names by looking for attributes

28
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:14,423
where the value is an instance of

29
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,298
property. We'll insert a new section into

30
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,678
the body of the class decorator itself to

31
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:22,023
search for and wrap any class attributes

32
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,974
which are properties. This delegates to a

33
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:26,112
new function called

34
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:35,277
wrap_property_with_invariant_checking_proxy.

35
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:37,172
This function retrieves the property from

36
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:39,743
the class, and passes it and the predicate

37
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:42,110
function, to the constructor of a new

38
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,203
class, InvariantCheckingPropertyProxy. We

39
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:50,025
use setattr to replace the property with

40
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,177
the proxy. The

41
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,908
InvariantCheckingPropertyProxy is itself a

42
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,222
descriptor, implementing dunder get,

43
00:01:57,222 --> 00:02:00,537
dunder set, and dunder delete. The

44
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,647
initializer simply stores references to

45
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:05,429
the referent property and the predicate

46
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,165
function. The implementations of dunder

47
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:11,216
get, dunder set, and dunder delete forward

48
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,918
to the underlying referent property, and

49
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:18,050
then check that the class invariant of the

50
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,716
instance remains unviolated. A quick test

51
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:23,322
at the REPL shows that everything is

52
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:25,513
working as designed. We'll create a

53
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,379
Temperature of 42 Kelvin, try to use the

54
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,776
Celsius setter to set a temperature of

55
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,129
-300 Celsius, which results in a runtime

56
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:36,684
error, showing that our

57
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:39,350
InvariantCheckingPropertyProxy is working.

58
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,603
A temperature of 100 Fahrenheit is

59
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:44,232
admissible, and we can convert that to

60
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:48,000
Celsius. Everything seems to be working fine.
