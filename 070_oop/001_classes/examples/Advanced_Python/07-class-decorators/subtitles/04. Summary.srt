00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,925
Let's summarize. Class decorators provide

2
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:06,753
a simple alternative to metaclasses for

3
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:09,369
processing class definitions prior to the

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,244
definition being bound to the class name.

5
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,671
Remember, though, that class decorators

6
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,816
are less powerful than metaclasses. Use

7
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:20,551
class decorators when you can and

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,374
metaclasses when you must. Thanks for

9
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:30,000
watching, and we'll see you in the next module on abstract base classes.
