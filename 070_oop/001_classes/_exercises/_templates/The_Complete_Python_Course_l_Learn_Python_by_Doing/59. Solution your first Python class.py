# # We've already defined a movie class like this:
# c_ Movie
#     ___ -  ____ new_name new_director
#         ____.name = ?
#         ____.director = ?
# 
#     # let's try to add a method `print_info()` here:
#     ___ print_info ____
#         print('<<@>> by @'.f.. ____.n.. ____.d..
# 
# 
# # You only need to finish the method, we will take care of the object creation and call your method for you!
