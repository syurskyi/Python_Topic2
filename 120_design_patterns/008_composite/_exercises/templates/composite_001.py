# *What is this pattern about?
# The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the
# same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of
# a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent
# part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients
# treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
#
# *What does this example do?
# The example implements a graphic c_ï¼Œwhich can be either an ellipse
# or a composition of several graphics. Every graphic can be printed.
#
# *Where is the pattern used practically?
# In graphics editors a shape can be basic or complex. An example of a
# simple shape is a line, where a complex shape is a rectangle which is
# made of four line objects. Since shapes have many operations in common
# such as rendering the shape to screen, and since shapes follow a
# part-whole hierarchy, composite pattern can be used to enable the
# program to deal with all shapes uniformly.
