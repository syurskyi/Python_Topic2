# """
# *What is this pattern about?
#
# The Chain of responsibility is an object oriented version of the
# `__ ... elif ... elif ... else ...` idiom, with the
# benefit that the conditionâ€“action blocks can be dynamically rearranged
# and reconfigured at runtime.
#
# This pattern aims to decouple the senders of a request from its
# receivers by allowing request to move through chained
# receivers until it is handled.
#
# Request receiver in simple form keeps a reference to a single successor.
# As a variation some receivers may be capable of sending requests out
# in several directions, forming a `tree of responsibility`.
#
# *TL;DR
# Allow a request to pass down a chain of receivers until it is handled.
