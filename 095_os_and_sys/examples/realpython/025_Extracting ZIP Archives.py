# The zipfile module allows you to extract one or more files from ZIP archives through .extract() and .extractall().
#
# These methods extract files to the current directory by default. They both take an optional path parameter
# that allows you to specify a different directory to extract files to. If the directory does not exist,
# it is automatically created. To extract files from the archive, do the following:
#
# >>> import zipfile
# >>> import os
#
# >>> os.listdir('.')
# ['data.zip']
#
# >>> data_zip = zipfile.ZipFile('data.zip', 'r')
#
# >>> # Extract a single file to current directory
# >>> data_zip.extract('file1.py')
# '/home/terra/test/dir1/zip_extract/file1.py'
#
# >>> os.listdir('.')
# ['file1.py', 'data.zip']
#
# >>> # Extract all files into a different directory
# >>> data_zip.extractall(path='extract_dir/')
#
# >>> os.listdir('.')
# ['file1.py', 'extract_dir', 'data.zip']
#
# >>> os.listdir('extract_dir')
# ['file1.py', 'file3.py', 'file2.py', 'sub_dir']
#
# >>> data_zip.close()
#
# The third line of code is a call to os.listdir(), which shows that the current directory has only one file, data.zip.
#
# Next, you open data.zip in read mode and call .extract() to extract file1.py from it. .extract() returns
# the full file path of the extracted file. Since thereâ€™s no path specified, .extract() extracts file1.py
# to the current directory.
#
# The next line prints a directory listing showing that the current directory now includes the extracted file
# in addition to the original archive. The line after that shows how to extract the entire archive into
# the zip_extract directory. .extractall() creates the extract_dir and extracts the contents of data.zip into it.
# The last line closes the ZIP archive.
