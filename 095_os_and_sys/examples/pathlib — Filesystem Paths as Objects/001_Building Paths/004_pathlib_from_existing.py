# Given an existing path object, it is easy to build a new one with minor differences such as referring to a different file in the same directory. Use with_name() to create a new path that replaces the name portion of a path with a different file name. Use with_suffix() to create a new path that replaces the file nameâ€™s extension with a different value.

py = ind.with_name('pathlib_from_existing.py')
print(py)

pyc = py.with_suffix('.pyc')
print(pyc)

# Both methods return new objects, and the original is left unchanged.
