# # Link:
#
# my_string = "Hello, world!"
# single_quote_string = 'Hello, world!'
#
# # Strings can use either single or double quotes. It's up to you which one you use!
# # Try to pick one and stick to it throughout all your code.
# # If you work with others, and they prefer a specific style, you can all agree on which to use.
#
# string_with_quotes = "Hello, it's me."
# another_with_quotes = 'He said "You are amazing!" yesterday.'
#
# # If your string has quotation marks, make sure to use the other mark for the string itself
# # Another option is to escape the quotation marks, but it is uglier and generally advised against:
#
# escaped_quotes = "He said \"You are amazing!\" yesterday."
#
# ### String formatting
#
# # You can add strings together to concatenate them (join them together).
#
# name = 'Jose'
# greeting = 'Hello, ' + name
#
# print(greeting)
#
# # You can also use f-strings if you are using Python 3.6 or later.
# # f-strings don't work in Python 3.5 or earlier.
# # In f-strings, {name} gets replaced by the value of the variable name.
#
# # another_greeting = f'How are you, {name}?' # higher 3.6
# another_greeting = 'How are you @?'.f.. ?
# another_greeting2 = 'How are you @n..?'.f.. n.._n..
# print(another_greeting)
# print(another_greeting2)
#
# name = 'Fred'
# age = 42
# print('He said his name is @ and he is @ years old.'.f..  n..  a..
#
# name = 'Fredddddy'
# age = 42
# print('He said his name is @n.. and he is @a.. years old.'.f..  n.._n.. a.._a..
#
#
#
# # Finally, it's also possible to use the format method.
# # We've not looked at methods yet, but it works this way:
#
# final_greeting = 'How are you, @?'
# print ?.f.. n..
# 
# # The {} gets replaced by whatever is inside the brackets of the .format()
# # Later on in the course we'll look at more examples of this, as it can be useful sometimes.
#
# # I would always advise to use f-strings wherever possible!
